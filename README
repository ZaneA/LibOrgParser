LibOrgParser
Written by Zane Ashby

A very simple library for reading org-mode files and pulling basic information from them.
Probably needs a lot more work to be genuinely useful but this is good enough for me at the moment.

See LICENSE for license covering code files in liborgparser directory.

Usage:
Each directory contains a single makefile, tested on Windows, but should be cross platform.
These will build the library, and the example programs.
The example.org file is also included for testing. As you can see it is very basic.
